# **ToasterApp**

**Description**  
A Java-based graphical application that simulates a toaster with customizable items and logging for tracking method calls and program behavior. The application features an interactive GUI built with `JFrame` and `JPanel`, allowing users to toast different items like Toast, PopTarts, and Waffles. The interface supports multiple languages and logs key events such as method entries, exits, and constructor calls for debugging purposes. Object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are utilized to build the structure and functionality of the app.

## **Features**

- **Graphical User Interface**: A clean and intuitive interface where users can input the item they want to toast and view the corresponding image and cook time. Built with `JFrame` and `JPanel` for visual structure.
- **Multilingual Support**: The interface supports English (`en_US`) and German (`de_DE`) locales, dynamically updating the text on the screen based on the selected language.
- **Custom Toaster Items**: Toast, PopTart, and Waffle, each represented by a specific class in the `ToasterItem` class hierarchy, which defines common attributes like name and cook time.
- **Dynamic Item Creation**: The `ToasterItemCreator` class dynamically creates items based on user input. If an unrecognized item is entered, an `UnrecognizedItemException` is thrown.
- **Logging**: Detailed logging of program execution using `AssignmentLogger`, capturing key method calls, constructor invocations, parameters, and machine-specific details such as the OS and Java version.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: The program makes use of key OOP principles:
  - **Encapsulation**: Each class manages its own state, such as item details, with controlled access via public methods.
  - **Inheritance**: Items like `Toast`, `PopTart`, and `Waffle` inherit common behavior from the `ToasterItem` superclass, while also extending their own functionality (e.g., image path).
  - **Polymorphism**: The program can handle different item types (e.g., Toast, PopTart, Waffle) interchangeably through the `ToasterItem` interface, allowing flexible item management.

## **Running the Program**

1. Run the `ToasterGUI.java` file to launch the application.
   - Enter the item to toast (e.g., "Toast", "PopTart", "Waffle").
   - Press "Push-down" to toast the item and display its image and cook time.
   - Switch between English and German using the language buttons.
2. Check the logs generated by `AssignmentLogger` to view method call details, parameters, and application behavior.

## **Checklist**

- Create the GUI using `JFrame` and `JPanel`.
- Implement support for multiple languages with `Locale_en_US.properties` and `Locale_de_DE.properties`.
- Add custom toaster items using the `ToasterItem` class and its subclasses (e.g., `Toast`, `PopTart`, `Waffle`).
- Use `AssignmentLogger` for detailed logging of method entries, exits, and other key events.
- Handle unrecognized toaster items with a custom exception (`UnrecognizedItemException`).
- Apply object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to manage toaster items and GUI behavior.
