# **ToasterApp**

**Description**  
A Java-based graphical application that simulates a toaster with customizable items and logging for tracking method calls and program behavior. The application features an interactive GUI built with `JFrame` and `JPanel`, allowing users to toast different items like Toast, PopTarts, and Waffles. The interface supports multiple languages and logs key events such as method entries, exits, and constructor calls for debugging purposes.

## **Features**

- A graphical interface where users can input the item they want to toast and view the corresponding image and cook time.
- Supports English (`en_US`) and German (`de_DE`) locales, dynamically updating the interface based on the selected language.
- Custom toaster items such as `Toast`, `PopTart`, and `Waffle`, each with its own image and cook time, are handled by the `ToasterItem` class hierarchy.
- The `ToasterItemCreator` class dynamically creates items based on user input, and an exception is thrown if an unrecognized item is entered.
- Detailed logging of program execution using `AssignmentLogger`, capturing method calls, parameters, and machine-specific details such as the OS and Java version.

## **Running the Program**

1. Run the `ToasterGUI.java` file to launch the application.
   - Enter the item to toast (e.g., "Toast", "PopTart", "Waffle").
   - Press "Push-down" to toast the item and display its image.
   - Switch between English and German using the language buttons.
2. Check the logs generated by `AssignmentLogger` to view method call details and application behavior.

## **Checklist**

- Create the GUI using `JFrame` and `JPanel`.
- Implement support for multiple languages with `Locale_en_US.properties` and `Locale_de_DE.properties`.
- Add custom toaster items using the `ToasterItem` class and its subclasses.
- Use `AssignmentLogger` for detailed logging of method entries, exits, and other key events.
- Handle unrecognized toaster items with a custom exception.
